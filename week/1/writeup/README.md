### Part 2 (75 pts)


As a developer in this situation, I would have the ethical responsibility to share the problems that
I found in the code, especially since the bugs could potentially pose a threat to human lives. The
people who would purchase the cars that my company is manufacturing have no opportunity to look at
the source code for the components within the car they are buying, and as such, it is the duty of
the developers to make sure that the code they release is secure. 

After discovering the problems, I would first notify my direct superior in hope that they would deal
with the issue appropriately. In case that my boss does not take the issue seriously, or is 
otherwise convinced to not solve the problem, I would try to notify others within the company of
the issue in hope to keep the issue private. If I couldnâ€™t solve the problem within the company,
I would choose to contact public organizations such as consumer watchdog and the media to make sure
the issue is properly handled. 

In this situation, if I had done nothing, the fault of any harm due to the software problems would
be on me, since I did not notify others of the problem. It is better to tell others about the
problem than it is to assume that they already know the issue is there. By consciously not
informing others, I would have partial blame for any harm since I did not do my part in getting
the issue fixed properly.
